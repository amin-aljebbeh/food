# Instructions

During this test, we wil examine your Github skills as you will work in a team of engineers, and require that you follow the standard Quality Assurance (QA). During the text you will work on your own, but later on when hired you will work in a team.

You will need to push your code daily to this Github Repository. The more commits per day you can make during your progress, the better it is for our team to review. Helpful comments on each commit are preferred to see how you manage your Git commits.

# App Description

Below you will find the details of what you need to build. Expected delivery timeline: 2 weeks. The faster you deliver, the better you are in our interviewing evaluation process.

You are expected to deliver a working App (.APK file for Android, or an iOS App; you can decide whatever suitable for your development environment).

The product is a Sketching App for contractors. The user of the App is a contractor/builder who goes to houses to build fences in the backyard/garden, by first drawing them on the App (using touch screen by finger), showing them to the customer, then approving them and saving them on the database with the customer details.

- The main screen should be a grid view of the customers, showing the details of the customer that I click to take me to the View screen of that customer (no Editing capability required). And a button to create new customers at the top.

- The new customer screen will have the following fields: Name, Phone, Email, Notes text area. Below it I have a white area to sketch using my finger. Then I click Submit button to save the customer record (the sketch photo should be saved on the cloud, such as Amazon, Google, etc. of your choice).

- (Optional feature) Plus points for building a login system (no need for registration system, only login with sessions in the App). Please make the login credentials as follows: Username "contractor", Password: "12345".
